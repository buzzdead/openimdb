# Interactive searching through imdb with ability to store movies in a list.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Various ways to interact:
#### You can search after a name or part of a name of a movie (i.e Marvel) to return a list of movies matching that search.

#### Hovering over a poster on the left side will show you the link to imdb, clicking it will open a new tab and take you to imdb's page for the movie.

#### Clicking any table header will toggle a sort in ascending and descending order.

#### Toggling off any of the filters (movie, series, game) will filter out that type.

#### Hover over a title will show a modal of the movie.
#### Clicking one of those titles will add it to the Favorite List.
#### Having already clicked a unique title, clicking it again will remove it from the Favorite List

#### Clicking on the "Favorite List" button will display a new table with all movies stored in the Favorite List.
#### Clicking a movie title in the Favorite List will remove it from the Favorite List.

#### Clicking on the same button that once said "Favorite List", now "Search List", will return to the original Table with the current search that is active.
